/* Write a function called **coinChange** which accepts two parameters: 
an array of denominations and a value. 
The function should return the number of ways you can obtain the value 
from the given collection of denominations. 
You can think of this as figuring out the number of ways to make change 
for a given value from a supply of coins.*/

/* 
    Example 1,
    coins : [2,3,5]
    sum : 10

    Let's break it into smaller problems. We'll solve using Tabulation

    let tabulation = []; // Of size N+1, i.e. 11, in this case.

    Iteration 1: 
        current coin : 2
